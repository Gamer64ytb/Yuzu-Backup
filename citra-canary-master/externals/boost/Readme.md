Boost libraries - trimmed down for Citra
========================================

This is a subset of Boost v1.82.0 generated using the bcp tool. To get a list of boost modules guaranteed to exist, check the build script.

Updating this repo (on Windows)
===============================

To update the Boost version (or to add a new library) follow these steps:

  - Download Boost and extract the package, then launch Powershell and `cd` to the `boost_1_xx_0` directory.
  - Build the `bcp` tool:
    ```
    .\bootstrap.bat
    .\b2 tools\bcp
    ```

  - Store the boost directory in a variable for later use: `$boost_dir = $pwd`.
  - Add bcp to your path: `$env:Path += ";$boost_dir\bin.v2\tools\bcp\msvc-14.3\release\link-static\threading-multi"` (The correct output path should be printed by b2 during the build.)
  - `cd` to this repo's directory (`...\externals\boost\`)
  - Remove the existing boost from the repo: `rm -r boost` (This is only necessary if doing a Boost version upgrade, in case they removed any files in the new version.)
  - Run `.\build.cmd $boost_dir` to build a new trimmed down distro.
  - Add/remove all files in git and commit.
