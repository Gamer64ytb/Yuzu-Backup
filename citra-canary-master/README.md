## Releases

Citra has two main release channels: Nightly and Canary.

The [Nightly](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly) build is based on the master branch, and contains already reviewed and tested features.

The [Canary](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-canary) build is based on the master branch, but with additional features still under review. PRs tagged `canary-merge` are merged only into the Canary builds.

Both builds can be installed with the installer provided on the [website](https://citra-emu.org/download/), but those looking for specific versions or standalone releases can find them in the release tabs of the [Nightly](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly/releases) and [Canary](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-canary/releases) repositories.

Android builds can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

A Flatpak for Citra is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.citra_emu.citra). Details on the build process can be found in [our Flathub repository](https://github.com/flathub/org.citra_emu.citra).

## Development

Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where [our central repository](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra) is hosted.
For development discussion, please join us on our [Discord server](https://citra-emu.org/discord/) or at #citra-dev on libera.

If you want to contribute please take a look at the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Contributing) and [Developer Information](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Developer-Information).
