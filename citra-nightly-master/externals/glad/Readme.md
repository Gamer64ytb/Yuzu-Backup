These files were generated by the [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) OpenGL loader generator and have been checked in as-is. You can re-generate them using glad with the following command:

```
python -m glad --profile core --out-path glad/ --api "gl=4.3,gles2=3.2" --generator=c
```

You can also generate the source using [this site](https://glad.dav1d.de/):
1. Select '4.3' for GL, '3.2' for GLES2, and 'Core' for Profile.
2. Input the currently supported extensions from [here](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/blob/master/externals/glad/include/glad/glad.h#L9), plus any new required extensions.
3. Click Generate and download the generated source zip.
4. Unzip the new source over the current glad source files.
